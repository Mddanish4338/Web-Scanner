Problem Statement

In today's digital age, websites play a crucial role in our daily lives. However, many websites are not fully accessible to people with disabilities, leading to legal liabilities, reputational damage, and the exclusion of potential customers. This problem needs urgent attention and a robust solution.

Solution Overview

Our solution is to develop a platform or tool that automates the process of assessing and ensuring website accessibility compliance. This tool will scan websites for accessibility issues based on established standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and provide detailed reports on areas that need improvement.

Key Features

- *Automated Scanning*: Our tool will automatically scan websites for accessibility issues, covering navigation, content, forms, multimedia, and more.
- *Detailed Reports*: It will generate comprehensive reports highlighting accessibility issues found, along with recommendations for how to fix them.
- *Prioritization*: The tool will prioritize issues based on severity and impact, helping website owners address critical issues first.
- *Continuous Monitoring*: We'll offer a feature for continuous monitoring, allowing website owners to stay compliant over time as their sites evolve.
- *Educational Resources*: Our platform will provide educational resources and tutorials to help website owners understand accessibility requirements and implement solutions effectively.
